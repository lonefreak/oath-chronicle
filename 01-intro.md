In the time before the time there was the last King of our land. A greedy malicious tyrant that ruled in the name of self glory, vanity and power.

The members of the law making families, the so called Citizens, suffered a shameful life, their decisions ignored, their laws overruled.

The member of the Trade, Arts and Knowledge families, were crushed by force and smeared thin by intrigue. Money they possessed, but not whom to negotiate with.

The People also suffered, as they could not prosper or survive. War, famine and fear were the only vision they had. Dreaming in the dark, dying in the light.

When the Citizen families could finally agreed on a plan to overthrow the tyrant, the Trade, Arts and Knowledge families scraped their vaults and spawned the means for the Citizens to rebel. The People joined as fodder and blade and fire, and the alliance was born.

After a long and bloody war, the six Citizen families  prevailed, and became The Union Council. The king and his armies were gone.  The People remained the people and went back to their homes.

The Trade, Arts and Knowledge families prospered while helping the Empire to gather its strength again and became The Banks. And their children grew to become Denizens of the land and Advisors of The Council. 

With full pockets, they brought favors. With unrestricted access, came the secrets. And where favors and secrets exist there can be no Union.

Being the closest to the new capital - the Cradle - the Mayans - one of the Union Council families - quickly became a favorite in the inner circles of the Banks. Gossip and bribe led to prestige. Prestige led to voice. Voice led to law. And said the law that a Mayan should be the Chancelor. The Council debated and discussed and feared that a single ruler would foster problems of old.

With growing fear in one side and growing power on the other, another bloody time was prospected. But the Banks and the People knew that when giants fight, the earth get crushed. The balance tipped to the power side and the new law banned the Council. Exiles would be spared if they agreed to flee and never return. They did and no blood was shed.

The Chancelor and his family ruled alone for People and Bank, for expansion and prosperity, for secret and favor. Alone, but not for long...
