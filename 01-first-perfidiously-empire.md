## Overview

Perfidiously dominated the landscape.

The Portokali family favoured the People and fell into its grace. With a banner of many favors, they marched alone, no armies, no weapons. But no favors go without retribution. And those who control the favors, control the People. Black achieved richness and independency, and the Portokali march became too big as to threaten the end of the Empire. Black stopped Portokali in its last miles and the fight for the People's favor started.

Black ruined their finances and armies in this fight and put itself out of the pledge, but with enough will to derail the Portokali whims. The Mayan Chancelor took into their hands to support Black and brought them into the empire. The Portokali went too desperate to keep the balance between power and strength. They conquered the banner, but never the strength behind it.

Blue was the First Citizen, Lord of the Relics. So much to attract the fearful eyes of the Mayan Chancelor, who conspired with the the Arkem to replace a strong Citizen with a mild one. Blue fell, the Arkem raised.

The Arkem was the promissed Sucessor status - Lady of the Books and Relics - and was betrayed in the last moment.

The Uuchben - the Usurper family - infiltrated the lands with the help of the Discord, took over all territories, overruled the succession laws and cast the Mayan Empire away - Perfidiously, Arkems and Black, exiled and disgraced together with the the Arkem. No terror or blood except the Emperial one was shed. And from the shadows of the betrayal jumped the Blue, to become the first Citizen family of the new Empire.

The new Chancelor, Uuchben, raised The Keep in the Plains.
